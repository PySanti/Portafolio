This was one of my first 'big projects' that I created shortly after learning how to handle data structures and dynamic memory in C, when I was 14 years old. A few months after learning my first programming language : Pascal. I made this project to be able to see graphically the ordering of a simple binary tree in the terminal. Following one of the traditions that I imposed on myself when I was starting to program, I didn't look for any kind of source or reference to build what I wanted to build, all the code of the project was written and devised by me, including what for me was the most complicated : the algorithm of ordering of the nodes to graph when inserting a new node, a recursive algorithm.

It has taken me so far (02/2024) more than 9 months of development practically non-stop. Without a doubt it has been the most challenging project I have ever taken on. It has made me learn a huge amount of things, improving my knowledge in React (Hooks and states mainly), zustand, JWT, web security, Serializers, Middlewares, Authentication, endpoints and api's operation, the Django ORM, websockets, among many other things. It's incredible how many stages this project has gone through. It's really emotional for me to think about how much I've made this application grow. Without a doubt the most valuable project in my portfolio."
